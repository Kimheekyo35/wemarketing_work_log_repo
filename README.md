# Internship Work Log

This repository contains my daily work logs during my internship.

- Each file is a record of what I learned, researched, or worked on that day.
- No company code, confidential data, or internal documents are included.
- All contents are rewritten in a publicly shareable format.

The goal of this repository is to track personal growth and learning throughout the internship.
